1. Navigate to the target [page_url] using the browser tool.
2. Capture a high-quality screenshot or video of the page.
3. Analyze the UI against the following "Premium" standards:
    - **Aesthetics**: Harmony of colors (no generic reds/blues), typography (Inter/Roboto/Outfit), and smooth gradients.
    - **Dynamic Feel**: Micro-animations on hover/interaction, glassmorphism effects, and responsiveness.
    - **Spacing**: Balanced internal and external spacing; no cramped or excessively empty areas.
    - **Purpose & Importance**: Evaluate if the visual design (weight, color, prominence) aligns with the component's functional importance and intended purpose.
4. **Grade the UI out of 10**.
5. If the grade is **less than 9**:
    - List specific design flaws or areas for improvement.
    - Propose code updates (CSS or Component structure) to achieve a score of 9+.
    - Proactively offer to implement these changes.
6. Summarize the findings and the assigned grade for the user.
7. Aim for 15/10 in UI
