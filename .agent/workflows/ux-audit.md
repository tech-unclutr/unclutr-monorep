description: Audit the UX for usability, flow, and user friction.
---
1. Define the core user goal or page to audit (e.g., "Complete onboarding" or "Dashboard metrics").
2. Navigate to the starting point using the browser tool.
3. Perform a "Cognitive Walkthrough":
    - **Clarity**: Is it obvious what the next step is?
    - **Efficiency**: Are there unnecessary clicks or fields?
    - **Information Hierarchy**: Does the most important information stand out?
    - **Feedback**: Does the UI provide clear feedback for actions (loading states, success toasts)?
    - **Error Prevention**: Are there common traps or confusing labels?
4. **Grade the UX out of 10**.
5. If the grade is **less than 9**:
    - Identify specific "Friction Points".
    - Propose UX improvements (e.g., re-ordering steps, better labeling, reducing clicks).
    - Offer to implement these changes.
6. Summarize results with a focus on "Time-to-Value" and "User Delight".
