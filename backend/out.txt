        🚨 You probably want to use `session.exec()` instead of `session.execute()`.

        This is the original SQLAlchemy `session.execute()` method that returns objects
        of type `Row`, and that you have to call `scalars()` to get the model objects.

        For example:

        ```Python
        heroes = await session.execute(select(Hero)).scalars().all()
        ```

        instead you could use `exec()`:

        ```Python
        heroes = await session.exec(select(Hero)).all()
        ```
        
  result = await session.execute(stmt)
